# Memory-Less Momentum quasi-Newton (MLMoQ) optimizer

This is the package for the MLMoQ algorithm based on the paper On the study of Memory-Less quasi-Newton Method with Momentum Term for Neural Network Training by S. Mahboubi, R. Yamatomi, Indrapriyadarsini, S., H. Ninomiya, and H. Asai.

It is currently available in Tensorflow version 2.6.0 is provided but not updated anymore.

MLMoQ takes the form of an Optimizer object that can be imported an used as any other optimizer (SGD, ADAM, etc.). 28x28 MNIST examples and explanations are provided.

* [Tensorflow Ver. 2.6.0](https://github.com/ninomiyalab/Memory_Less_Momentum_Quasi_Newton/blob/a7d42ae35b19e6906a4dbc6e58482822c65b049c/MLMoQ.py)
